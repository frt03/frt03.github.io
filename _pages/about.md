I am a Ph.D. student in Technology Management for Innovation at The University of Tokyo, working on deep reinforcement learning and foundation models. I am advised by [Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/) and mentored by [Shixiang Shane Gu](https://sites.google.com/view/gugurus/home). I was also recieved BEng and MEng at The University of Tokyo.

My research interest has focused on data-driven control towards real-world applications, and scalable decision making with large-scale models.
