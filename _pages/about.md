I am a master's student in Technology Management for Innovation at The University of Tokyo, working on Deep Reinforcement Learning. I am advised by [Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/) and mentored by [Shixiang Shane Gu](https://sites.google.com/view/gugurus/home).

My research interest has focused on data-driven control towards real-world application, and the nature of environments in deep reinforcement learning.
