<span style="font-size: 80%;">

I am a Ph.D. student in Technology Management for Innovation at The University of Tokyo, advised by [Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/). I am also a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, hosted by [Heiga Zen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z3IRvDwAAAAJ) and [Izzeddin Gur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qS_ugJAAAAAJ). I was also received BEng and MEng at The University of Tokyo, and closely mentored by [Shixiang Shane Gu](https://sites.google.com/view/gugurus/home).



My research interest has focused on data-driven control towards real-world applications (e.g. robotics, web navigation), and scalable decision making with large-scale foundation models.
